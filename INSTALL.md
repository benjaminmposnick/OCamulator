# Installation

- To install our software, simply run `make build`.

- To delete any build files, run `make clean`.

- To run the test suite, run `make test`.

- Most importantly, to use the command line application that runs our calculator,
run `make start`. 

Try entering basic mathematical expressions (e.g. addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, exponentiation). No promises that this is bug free
(yet!) but you should be able to use familiar syntax from other online and
scientific calculators. You should see both the parsed input and the final
result (if that functionality is not yet fully functional, you may see an error).
New functionality is coming in the next sprint -- stay tuned!
